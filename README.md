# Optimizing Next-Generation Sequencing-based Training Using the Carpentries

## Abstract

The Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core provides consulting and training services to the Harvard community. Six years ago, we initiated a new training program designed to empower researchers not only to understand next-generation sequencing, but also to perform analysis of their own data. Many of the elements used to build the foundation of this program were drawn from organizational ideas, material formatting and content of the Carpentries. We will explore how the Carpentries have aided us in achieving our goal of making NGS analysis accessible to experimental researchers. From the organizational perspective, we have utilized strategies based on Carpentry workshops such as using red and green stickies to denote whether or not there are problems during the workshop and post-workshop surveys to assess workshop satisfaction and areas for improvement. Also, critical to our mission and success of our program has been the design of our workshop material, which is based on Carpentry design. We have strived to teach solely from markdown lessons so that participants can follow along and easily catch up if they fall behind; however, this design has also allowed for participants to return to the material in the future for additional review. Fortuitously, the markdown design of lessons allowed us to easily pivot to a flipped-classroom workshop format during the Covid-19 pandemic, which allowed us the flexibility to have participants do much of the self-learning on their own, while we addressed questions and ran through exercises during shorter ‘in-class’ Zoom sessions. Finally, much of the content for our early workshops for R and the command line used the Carpentry material as a base to build from. Many of the main pedagogical methods from these lessons continue to be incorporated in our workshops, including the insertion of exercises throughout our lessons and the focus of interactivity. The Carpentries have been key for the set-up and success of our program, and we were fortunate to have had the Carpentries as our base from which to build.

## Introduction

The Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core (HBC) is comprised of a team of bioinformaticians who aid researchers within the Harvard community with the management, integration and contextual analysis of biological high-throughput data.

## Training Program Goals

Six years ago we initiated a new bioinformatics training program at HBC.

> **Goal:**
> _Empower experimental researchers to **understand next-generation sequencing methods** and analyses and to **perform high-quality analyses** of their own data._

To achieve this goal we envisioned the program to exhibit the following features:

- **Accessible:** individuals with little computational background (no programming experience) should be comfortable learning from our materials
- **Applicable:** researchers should be able to perform their own data analyses after taking analysis-specific workshops
- **Reviewable:** researchers should be able to return to the materials and review the concepts and code
- **Retentive:** workshops should optimize retention through assessments and review
- **Interactive:** workshops should be engaging by either interacting with instructors and/or each other

## Carpentries as a Foundation

We found the Carpentries' workshops to model many of these characteristics and used them as a base in the following ways:

- Organization of workshops
- Formatting of course materials
- Workshop content
